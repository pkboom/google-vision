# Manage Google Vision

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/pkboom/google-vision/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/pkboom/google-vision)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pkboom/google-vision.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pkboom/google-vision)

This package makes working with Google Vision a breeze. Once it has been set up you can do these things:

```php
use Pkboom\GoogleVision\GoogleVisionFactory;

$googleVision = GoogleVisionFactory::create();

$result = $googleVision->text($imagePath);
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require pkboom/google-vision
```

You must publish the configuration with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Pkboom\GoogleVision\GoogleVisionServiceProvider"
```

This will publish a file called google-calendar.php in your config-directory with these contents:

```php
return [
    /*
     * Path to the json file containing the credentials.
     */
    'service_account_credentials_json' => storage_path('app/service-account/credentials.json'),
];
```
